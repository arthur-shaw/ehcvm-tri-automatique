# TODO: Add option for custom ordering
# There are a few methods for this
# First is to have a unique severity rank for each issue and to rank by that
	# This would mean another parameter to arrange() above
# Second is to order by issueDesc
	# This would involve ordering by index, and the index would be provided by match
